# Plan: Current Image Generation Graphs And Stale Graph Diagnostics

2026-06-03 Tauri edit-session launcher deletion update: after the minimal
scheduler/runtime-host image inference path was proven, the unregistered
`run_workflow_execution_session` Tauri wrapper and desktop-local
`workflow_execution_runtime.rs` graph-snapshot launcher were deleted. The
app-facing TypeScript `runSession` boundary remains fail-closed and is covered
by a regression test that proves it throws before invoking a Tauri command.
Scheduler execution-session commands remain the only GUI workflow submission
path. Verification passed with Tauri fmt/check, frontend command tests,
typecheck, and deleted-symbol search; unrelated diagnostics/Pumas dead-code
warnings remain future cleanup candidates.

2026-06-03 Tauri event-adapter execution-graph hook deletion update: removed
the now-unused `TauriEventAdapter::with_execution_graph` builder and optional
adapter graph state left behind by the deleted edit-session launcher. This
does not add a graph snapshot fallback or scheduler adapter; graph snapshots
and diagnostics projection stay backend-owned. Verification passed with Tauri
fmt/check, event-adapter tests, and deleted-symbol search. The deletion exposes
`WorkflowDiagnosticsStore::set_execution_graph` as a separate dead diagnostics
helper cleanup candidate.

2026-06-03 Tauri diagnostics graph setter cleanup update:
`WorkflowDiagnosticsStore::set_execution_graph` is now test-only after the
production adapter caller was deleted. This removes a dead production graph
snapshot attachment API without adding any graph fallback or runtime launch
path, while preserving diagnostics graph-context projection coverage in tests.
Verification passed with Tauri fmt/check, diagnostics tests, event-adapter
tests, and diff hygiene.

2026-06-03 Tauri Pumas selector helper cleanup update: unused extension-based
Pumas selector helper wrappers in `puma_lib_commands.rs` are now test-only.
Production commands continue through backend-owned selector access and
access-based Pumas APIs; no owner-API fallback, path lookup, or runtime launch
branch was added. Verification passed with Tauri fmt/check, Pumas command
tests, and diff hygiene.

2026-06-03 Tauri runtime/scheduler snapshot event contract re-plan decision:
use Option 2, deleting the retired Tauri `WorkflowEvent::RuntimeSnapshot` and
`WorkflowEvent::SchedulerSnapshot` contract surface instead of quarantining
one helper or promoting a new backend event stream. The next implementation
slice must first inventory active consumers, then remove the event variants,
input DTOs, constructors, serialization/projection branches, and direct
`record_workflow_event` production helper only if they are proven unused by
active transport. Runtime and scheduler diagnostics snapshots must continue
through backend-owned diagnostics/headless snapshot APIs and store update/
record helpers. Tests that currently construct snapshot events should migrate
to the active diagnostics snapshot APIs. No Tauri business logic, graph
snapshot fallback, scheduler adapter, runtime launch branch, or compatibility
shim may be introduced. Option 1 is rejected because it leaves the dead event
contract in production; Option 3 remains deferred unless inspection finds a
live requirement for a backend-owned push snapshot event stream.

2026-06-03 Tauri runtime/scheduler snapshot event deletion update: the retired
Tauri event input DTOs, enum variants, constructors, serializer branches,
event-adapter ownership branches, diagnostics overlay event branches, and
trace projection branches were deleted. Diagnostics snapshot recording remains
backend-owned through diagnostics-store/headless record and update helpers;
test-only record helpers now write trace facts and snapshot state directly
instead of constructing Tauri events. Verification passed with Tauri
fmt/check, diagnostics tests, event-adapter tests, deleted-symbol search, and
diff hygiene. No graph snapshot fallback, scheduler adapter, runtime launch
branch, frontend-derived policy, or compatibility event shim was added.

2026-06-03 scheduler lifecycle hardening re-plan decision: use Option 2, the
attempt/lease state core path, before broader durable lifecycle work.
Workflow-service active-run orchestration must add scheduler-owned
attempt/lease transitions for claim/start/complete/fail/cancel, stale-attempt
rejection, duplicate-dispatch prevention, and reservation release hooks while
keeping runtime-host awaits outside store locks. This is the next thin
implementation path because it creates a single lifecycle/state owner without
folding retry policy, replay/recovery, worker supervision, and timing ledger
integration into one slice. Option 1, minimal in-memory guardrails, is
rejected as insufficient for the open lifecycle boundary. Option 3, a full
lifecycle supervisor, remains the target architecture after the attempt/lease
core exists. Option 4, moving contracts into `pantograph-scheduler`, is
deferred unless shared ownership is proven.

2026-06-03 scheduler attempt identity source update: workflow-service
active-run task execution now creates a scheduler-owned attempt id when a
ready runtime or non-runtime task starts. Completion and failure paths must
present the matching attempt id before mutating task state or task results;
duplicate starts and stale completions fail closed without recording results.
This keeps async task execution outside the store mutation boundary and adds no
graph path fallback, node-engine runtime launch, Tauri/frontend policy, or
compatibility shim. Remaining lifecycle work: explicit cancel attempt
transition, reservation-release intent wiring, retry/defer idempotency,
replay/recovery, worker supervision, and timing/attempt ledger facts.

2026-06-03 scheduler runtime dispatch error update: started runtime task
dispatch errors now terminally fail the matching active attempt instead of
using the retired broad active-run `runtime-dispatch-not-wired` helper. The
dead helper, transition builder, and direct test were removed. Runtime dispatch
selection no-candidate and runtime-host dispatch error paths both return to
attempt-aware terminal mutation without recording task results or adding any
legacy runtime launch branch.

2026-06-03 scheduler cancellation/reservation re-plan decision: use Option 2.
The next source slice must bind scheduler reservation metadata to the active
runtime task attempt after dispatch selection, add an explicit cancel
transition for the matching active attempt, and have synchronous store
transitions return typed reservation-release intent when a leased attempt ends
through cancel/failure/completion. The async orchestrator/session runner must
apply that intent through the reservation lifecycle port outside the store
lock. This keeps workflow-service as the single lifecycle/state owner without
moving business logic into Tauri/frontend or folding retry policy,
replay/recovery, worker supervision, and ledger timing facts into the same
slice. Cancellation may map to the existing terminal task-state diagnostic
until `pantograph-scheduler` grows a distinct cancelled state; that future
state expansion remains deferred unless shared scheduler semantics require it.

2026-06-03 scheduler reservation binding/cancel store update:
workflow-service active-run task attempts now carry typed reservation lease
metadata, terminal completion/failure/cancel store mutations return typed
reservation-release intent for leased attempts, and cancel uses the same
matching-attempt validation as completion/failure. Stale or duplicate
reservation binding fails closed. This does not apply release events yet; the
next slice must wire the async orchestrator/session runner to call the
reservation lifecycle port after the store mutation releases its lock. No
graph path fallback, reduced-plan launch, node-engine runtime launch,
Tauri/frontend policy, compatibility shim, or separate scheduler cancelled
state was added.

2026-06-03 scheduler reservation lifecycle application update: runtime
dispatch now uses an explicit selected-dispatch sequence: start the task
attempt, select dispatch, bind the selected reservation to that attempt,
dispatch through the runtime-host port, terminally mutate task state/results,
then apply reservation lifecycle release events outside the store lock.
Runtime-host success/failure release events now consume the terminal store
mutation's typed release intent instead of being emitted before the store
transition. Missing reservation lifecycle configuration still fails closed
before runtime-host dispatch. Remaining lifecycle work is retry/defer
idempotency, replay/recovery, durable duplicate-dispatch prevention, worker
supervision/cancellation tokens, and diagnostics-ledger attempt/timing facts.

2026-06-04 scheduler durable lifecycle supervisor re-plan decision: use Option
3 next. The attempt/lease core is now validated, so the next lifecycle work
must introduce a single workflow-service lifecycle supervisor through thin
slices: lifecycle manager skeleton, durable duplicate-dispatch/task lease
guardrails, cancellation/shutdown token ownership, retry/defer policy,
replay/bootstrap recovery, and diagnostics-ledger attempt/timing facts. These
must remain backend-owned and decomposed; do not move business logic into
Tauri/frontend, do not reintroduce graph-path or reduced-plan launch fallback,
and do not combine retry, replay, worker lifecycle, and ledger facts into one
source slice.

This plan is split into focused documents so each section stays readable while
still preserving the planning standards' required traceability, verification,

## Implementation Rule

Use `04-milestones.md` as the execution checklist. Update
`05-execution-management.md` after each validated slice with verification
results, deviations, follow-ups, and any standards concerns discovered during
implementation.

Pumas ordering rule: the Pumas plan is not implemented as the final Pantograph
step. Pumas P0-P1 starts immediately after Pantograph Milestone 0 freezes the
expected contract. Pumas P2-P5 may run in parallel with Pantograph Milestones
1-5, but must complete and be pinned before Pantograph Milestone 5a consumes
production model facts for scheduler dispatch, before Milestone 5c integrates
production task-level orchestration, before Milestone 5d resolves
model-specific inference interfaces, before Milestone 5b resolves runtime-host
load targets, and before Milestone 6 implements real PyTorch/diffusers image
execution.

2026-06-02 resource-estimate handoff update: the next Pantograph production
inference-facts provider slice is gated on the Pumas package artifact size facts
handoff in
`pumas-package-artifact-size-facts-handoff.md`. After Pumas publishes or pins
that contract, Pantograph should update its Pumas dependency and inference
package-facts DTOs, project logical artifact size facts through
embedded-runtime, and implement the conservative Pantograph-owned
model/load plus execution/context estimator. Until then, production dispatch
must continue to fail closed with typed missing-resource-estimate diagnostics
rather than deriving estimates from graph paths, selector summaries, UI state,
or legacy model-reference contracts.

2026-06-02 implementation note: the pushed untagged Pumas package-facts v3
commit is now pinned by SHA in Pantograph, and Pantograph mirrors/projects
logical artifact/file size facts through inference and embedded-runtime package
fact bridges. The remaining production inference-facts work is the
Pantograph-owned conservative estimator/provider and scheduler estimate-hint
population; no loaded-memory or admission policy was added in the DTO/projection
slice.

2026-06-02 estimator primitive update: embedded-runtime now has a pure
Pantograph-owned conservative estimator that transforms validated Pumas logical
size facts into inference resource-estimate DTOs and bounded scheduler
RAM/VRAM estimate hints. It uses checked arithmetic, rejects weak or missing
size evidence with typed unavailable estimates, and does not read graph paths,
selector summaries, UI state, Tauri policy, or runtime-registry state. The next
slice must wire a production `InferenceInterfaceFactsProvider` through backend
composition so resolver facts can receive these hints together with runtime,
device, task-shape, and proven-residency context.

2026-06-02 provider wiring update: resource-backed embedded-runtime workflow
service composition now installs a backend-owned
`InferenceInterfaceFactsProvider` before sharing the service. The provider
combines Pumas package facts, runtime-registry capability facts, and the
conservative logical-size estimator into workflow-service resolver facts. It
does not put business logic in Tauri or the frontend, and missing Pumas,
runtime, task, or estimate facts continue to fail closed through canonical
resolver/admission diagnostics instead of graph-path or selector-summary
fallbacks.

2026-06-03 dependency-readiness active-run lifecycle re-plan update: the
implemented first-run deferral path remains valid: workflow-service enqueues
dependency-readiness work, records typed deferred scheduler state, blocks
runtime dispatch, and returns typed runtime-not-ready diagnostics when no fresh
backend readiness proof exists. The public runtime session lifecycle now keeps
dependency-readiness pending as a non-terminal backend-owned active-run state,
not a finished workflow run. The explicit backend-owned resume API for an
existing active `session_id` plus `workflow_run_id` is now implemented in
workflow-service: it validates active runtime scheduler state, retries
dependency-readiness admission from fresh canonical backend facts, preserves
the active run when facts are still missing, and completes runtime dispatch
without requiring a replacement client-created workflow run. The selected
host-boundary forwarder is also implemented through embedded-runtime, the
Tauri command facade, and the TypeScript workflow command service; it forwards
only `session_id` and `workflow_run_id` and does not own retry, readiness,
resource, package, or scheduler policy. The manual-use re-plan is now
implemented: run-list and run-detail projections expose an optional typed
backend read-model field for dependency-readiness resume eligibility, populated
by workflow-service from live active-run scheduler task state. The Scheduler UI
only displays that backend fact and forwards `session_id` plus
`workflow_run_id` to the existing backend command; it does not infer
resumability from generic `running` status, scheduler reason strings, error
text, graph paths, selector summaries, or Tauri state. The next implementation
step is the deferred event-driven backend readiness lifecycle: a
composition-root-owned embedded-runtime lifecycle handle that coordinates the
existing snapshot producer, workflow-service resume-candidate query, embedded
backend host, and explicit backend resume API. It must track tasks, support
idempotent shutdown, prevent overlapping resumes for the same active run,
apply bounded retry/backoff behavior, and log lifecycle failures at the owner.
Tauri remains a thin composition/handle manager and must not own retry,
readiness, scheduler, package, or resource policy. Missing, stale, or
insufficient facts remain typed fail-closed diagnostics, not graph-path,
Tauri, frontend, selector-summary, synchronous probe, client rerun, or legacy
preflight fallback. Future improvement: replace bounded polling with a typed
snapshot notification/event channel after the lifecycle is working, if
responsiveness or idle overhead requires it.

2026-06-03 auto-resume lifecycle handle update: embedded-runtime now exports
the tracked `DependencyReadinessAutoResume` lifecycle component with focused
tests for shutdown, empty candidate polling, duplicate suppression, successful
resume attempts, pending-readiness preservation, and poll-interval validation.
The follow-up source slice wires a real embedded-runtime resume port through
hosted and standalone composition so production startup returns/manages this
handle beside the snapshot producer while Tauri remains a thin handle manager.

2026-06-03 auto-resume production wiring update: the real embedded-runtime
resume port is wired. It lists workflow-service resume candidates and calls
the existing backend resume API with an embedded workflow host. Standalone
runtime construction owns the handle, hosted Tauri startup creates the handle
through embedded-runtime host construction and only stores/shuts down the
returned handle, and shutdown stops auto-resume before tearing down runtime
resources. The remaining improvement is optional event-first notification
after the bounded polling path is proven under real inference workflow smoke.

2026-06-03 complete-path proof update: embedded-runtime now has session-level
coverage proving a workflow-service scheduler session can dispatch through the
production-composed `EmbeddedRuntimeHostExecutionPort`, resolve Pumas load
targets and package facts, execute image generation through the inference
gateway, persist media through the backend artifact writer, map the completed
runtime-host response into scheduler task results, and return the requested
workflow output as a path-free artifact reference. This completes the minimal
image inference path proof. Remaining work moves to deleting/replacing
retired node-engine/planned-inference launch paths, then continuing
dependency-readiness producer lifecycle and durable scheduler hardening in
separate validated slices.

2026-06-03 retired dependency contract diagnostic cleanup update: active
node-engine and embedded-runtime Rust source/tests no longer mention the
retired concrete contract names `ModelDependencyRequest`,
`ModelDependencyResolver`, `ModelRefV2`, `build_model_ref_v2`, or
`PlannedInferenceExecutionHost`. Fail-closed diagnostics now use generic
retired dependency/model-reference contract language while still blocking
before legacy request, resolver, model-reference, or adapter dispatch behavior.

2026-06-03 dependency activity path-key cleanup update: active dependency-
environment action/activity transport no longer keys user-visible dependency
activity by `modelPath` or `model_path`. The backend-owned diagnostic activity
event carries optional `target_node_id`, Tauri forwards the event without
policy, and the frontend matcher compares that id to the current
dependency-environment node. The activity log remains display/history state
only and cannot produce runtime launch facts, readiness proofs, scheduler
policy, or load authority.

2026-06-03 retired frontend renderer cleanup update: app-local direct runtime
node renderers for PyTorch, llama.cpp, and reranking were deleted, and the
unused shared-package llama.cpp renderer export was removed. Canonical app
workflows render through `LLMInferenceNode.svelte` and backend descriptors
instead of path-era direct runtime node components. The older exported package
`PumaLibNode.svelte` still carries path-shaped mock UI and is explicitly left
as a separate delete-or-rewrite follow-up because it is a package API surface,
not an app-local orphaned renderer.

2026-06-03 backend graph-mutation validation auto-trigger update:
workflow-service semantic graph mutations now cancel stale validation and start
one backend-owned validation task for the committed current graph revision.
Layout-only node-position edits, connection candidate lookup, and insertion
previews remain non-triggering. Validation freshness, task lifecycle, and
typed rejection behavior stay backend-owned; Tauri/frontend overlay consumption
remains a later presentation slice.

2026-06-03 validation projection read-model update: workflow-service now owns a
read-only current validation projection query that returns the stored backend
summary plus node projections for the caller-observed current graph revision
without starting validation. Stale or missing state returns typed summary
diagnostics and no projections. Tauri and frontend service code forward the
query by graph session/revision only, so the next presentation slice can
consume validation lifecycle events without re-running validation or deriving
descriptor overlays locally.

2026-06-03 toolbar lifecycle projection update: `WorkflowToolbar.svelte` now
consumes graph-validation lifecycle events through the backend current
validation projection read model. Lifecycle handling applies backend-provided
node overlays and summary state without calling validation refresh, deriving
descriptor overlays, or computing validation freshness in frontend code.

## Standards Rule

The standards constraints in
`02-image-generation-family-planner.md#standards-guardrails` and
`02-image-generation-family-planner.md#standards-compliance-matrix`, plus the
device/runtime constraints in `06-device-runtime-selection.md`, are binding
for every milestone. The directory READMEs in this plan are also part of the
documentation-traceability contract for the split plan structure. If
implementation needs to violate one of these constraints, stop and re-plan
before editing production code.
